# notes_topic_modeling

Using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) to automatically group my school notes into folders by performing topic modeling on the 'bag of words' features.

Note:
I am using notability to write my notes. Notability is able to extract the text from the notes which is what I am using
for this topic modeling pipeline. Overall, the accuracy which Notability converts this handwriting to text is not
100% which affects the downstream analyses.
