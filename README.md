# notes_topic_modeling

Using machine learning to automatically group my school notes into folders.

I am using notability to write my notes. Notability is able to extract the text from the notes which is what I am using
for this topic modeling pipeline. Overall, the accuracy which Notability converts this handwriting to text is not
100% which affects the downstream analyses.

Overall, it's able to group the notes with some level of accuracy, however, the results are not very stable. Furthermore,
much of my coursework is math related which also is difficult to differentiate with LDA.
